Imagine having some cool stuff written here about the documentation of a specific project. This is just one "post", but perhaps every project could have its own "post". and with a search function 
and descriptive tagging on all of the posts, it could be pretty robust. I think below is just some code highlighting. Not sure because I haven't looked at it just yet, but that's what
I imagine.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
